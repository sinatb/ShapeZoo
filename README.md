# Shape Zoo

Shape zoo is a simple project in c++ using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/). Nothing to fancy here :)

Just some simple Shape rendering, Collision and Text rendering. You can add your own shapes and tests following the 
style of tests in the test-files folder. Add your new files in the folder and change the path value in the `TextParser` 
constructor class to your local path.
